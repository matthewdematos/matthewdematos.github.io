  <h2>Why I Love Maps</h2>
  <p>I have always been obsessed with maps, from atlases to globes to interactive maps online.</p>
  <p>I can point to three things throughout my life that were the reason I fell/stayed in love with maps.</p>
  <p>Click the links to see them!</p>
  <p>The first was an <a href="https://www.argos.co.uk/product/9375262" class="ext" target="_blank">interactive globe</a> I got for Christmas when I was
    seven years old.<br>I kept it into my teen years, until the batteries exploded and ruined it.</p>
  <p>The second is the <a href="https://www.serebii.net/pokearth/" class="ext" target="_blank">Pokémon world</a> that I fell in love with as a child.<br>
  I even made my own Pokémon region on Paint. Thus began my interest in video game maps!</p> 
  <p>Finally, the <a href="https://www.sporcle.com/user/pokabu/" class="ext" target="_blank">trivia website</a> I have been playing on for over 13 years, Sporcle. You can see on my profile that geography<br>
  is my favourite subject, so I had to learn all the countries and their capitals. That meant staring at lots of maps, for a long time.</p>

  <h2>A Wild Life Filled with Wildlife!</h2>
  <p>As you can see on my resume, I spent two field seasons working for the Toronto Wildlife Centre after<br>
  volunteering with them for over a year. We usually can't share photos that we take, so enjoy this exclusive<br>
  peek into the life of a wildlife rehabilitator!</p>
